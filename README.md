# Python-Data_Visualizations_Projects

These projects are written in Python for my Data Visualizations course. Projects 1 and 2 are focused on learning basic data visualization techniques, datasets, and special Python libraries. The final project (under folder HMW4_final) is a Tkinter-based interactive UI used to display data gathered from patients wearing fitness wrist bands.
